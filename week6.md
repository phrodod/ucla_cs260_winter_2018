# Week 6 assignments

Our approach for assignments will be to cover the topics from the Syllabus. This week's topics come from week 4 of the syllabus plus homework 3:

* Error and Noise
* Theory of Generalization, VC Dimension, and Bias-Variance Tradeoff
* Overfitting, Regularization, and Validation

The assignment for week 4 was to read chapter 1.4, which covers Error and
Noise; chapter 2, which covers Generalization, VC Dimension, Bias-Variance
Tradeoff; and chapter 4, which covers Overfitting, Regularization, and
Validation.

The instructor already issued [homework 3], which has several questions
covering Section 1.4 and Chapter 2. In addition, the CalTech course provided
additional homework that tests your conceptual knowledge with multiple choice
questions.

Fortunately for me, we already have some great lectures covering these topics
from CalTech.  Here are links to the videos. Each of these videos runs about an
hour, with an extra 15 minutes or so of Q&A.

* Lecture 4: [Error and Noise]
* Lecture 6: [Theory of Generalization]
* Lecture 7: [The VC Dimension]
* Lecture 8: [Bias-Variance Tradeoff]

I will plan a session on Saturday at 11 AM to cover Chapter 2. Expect this
session to be recorded, and then posted to YouTube unlisted. This will provide
you with the discussion, and I'll also take notes which will be posted after
the session.
 
* Lecture 11: [Overfitting]
* Lecture 12: [Regularization]
* Lecture 13: [Validation]

I'll plan a session on Sunday at 2 PM to cover this material. Both of these
sessions will be very much group participation. Please plan on coming ready to
discuss the problems from the homework, and bring all your questions. Or even
better, post the questions here ahead of time to give your fellow students time
to think about them.

Since we're now in week 6 of 10, we've got a lot of catching up to do. Alex
Clement is taking on preparation for week 5 materials, which cover Decision
Trees, Random Forests, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis, and Naive Bayes
Algorithm. If you are aware of any good materials that cover these topics,
please share them with Alex (or with everybody). We should have the seminar on
that topic next week either on Saturday or during the week. While weekends
generally work better for me, I know that weekends often get filled with other
activity, too. Let us know what works for you.

We should also cover week 6 next week, which covers Nearest Neighbors and
k-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines. These topics are also covered
by the e-chapters from the book in chapters 6 and 8. I've asked Mimi Chiang to
take on leading the seminar on syllabus week 6. I believe that Zoom session
would be Sunday, 2/25.
